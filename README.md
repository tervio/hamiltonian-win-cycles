# hamiltonian-win-cycles
Find and graphically illustrate a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph where wins are directed edges.
A Hamiltonian win cycle is a closed loop that includes exactly one win by all teams in a league: A beat B beat C ... Z beat A.

All the code is in the nb-file. Evaluating the whole notebook in Mathematica should recreate the example output using the example input, which is the match data from Premier League season 2023-24 (up until 2023-11-06, which is when the earlest Hamiltonian cycle was completed).
